# Prediction-of-Miles-per-Gallon-on-Car-dataset-using-Regression-Analysis
The objective of this regression prediction project using the mtcars dataset is to develop a model that can predict the fuel efficiency (measured in miles per gallon, or mpg) of a car based on its various characteristics, such as its engine size, horsepower, and weight. The model is trained using historical data from the mtcars dataset, which includes information on 32 different cars and their corresponding mpg values and characteristics.
The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the mpg of new cars based on their characteristics, with the ultimate objective of helping car manufacturers and consumers make more informed decisions about fuel efficiency.
The success of the project is measured by the model's ability to accurately predict mpg values on new data that was not used during the training process. Finally at the end we obtain all necessary results, conclusions along with interpretation.
